# TwiLite - Privacy Policy
Last Updated: 20th January 2025

Effective: 20th January 2025

## Introduction
**TwiLite** does __not__, and will __never__, collect & store Messages, User Data, or Server Data without explicit notice & consent.
Additionally, **TwiLite** will __never__ sell or give away the Data that it does store.

The developers of **TwiLite** firmly believes in a "we don't want your data keep it away from us" process - thus, **TwiLite** will be developed as "stateless" as possible (i.e: without needing to store any information or data at all). If features and functions are not possible to develop "stateless", we will explicitly include them in this **Privacy Policy**, covering exactly what is needed to be stored, for what purpose, and how that data can be removed from **TwiLite** on request.

**TwiLite**'s source code is viewable in **TwiLite**'s GitHub Repo ( https://github.com/TwilightZebby/TwiLite ).

# Logging
**TwiLite** will log when it has been added (otherwise referred to as authorized) as a Server App to a Discord Server or as a User App to a User's account.

The only information included in this log are:
- **When added as a Server App:**
  - Which User added **TwiLite** to a Server (specifically, the User's display/user name, and ID)
  - Which Server **TwiLite** was added to (specifically, the Server's name & ID)
  - and which Scopes **TwiLite** was authorized with (commonly `application.commands` for its Slash Commands, and `bot` for its Bot User)
- **When added as a User App:**
  - Which User added **TwiLite** as a User App (specifically, the User's display/user name, and ID)
  - and which Scopes **TwiLite** was authorized with (commonly `application.commands` for its Slash Commands, and `bot` for its Bot User)

This is purely for informational purposes (such as tracking the App's growth), and this information will NOT be given or sold to anyone else.

## Use of Locale Data
**TwiLite** makes use of the publicly available locale data (i.e: what language Users and Servers have set) Discord sends to all Server/User Apps using Discord's public API for "Interactions" (e.g: Slash Commands, Context Commands, Select Menus, Buttons, Modals). This locale data is only used for knowing which language **TwiLite** should send its responses in, and is __NOT__ stored or tracked in any way.

You can see the public API Documentation regarding what the locale data includes on these official Discord API Documentation Pages:
- [API Locale Reference](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#locales)
- [Locale field in Interaction Objects](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-object)

## Final Notes
If you decide to stop using **TwiLite** as a Server App, then **TwiLite** will automatically remove all data connected to a Server when it is removed or kicked from the Server in question.

If, as a User, you have left all Servers **TwiLite** is in as a Server App (and thus, no longer have any mutual Servers with **TwiLite**), then **TwiLite** will automatically remove all data connected to the User in question.

If you have added **TwiLite** to your Discord Account as a User App, and you no longer want it as a User App, you can freely remove it again at any time by navigating to Discord's User Settings -> Authorized Apps, and revoking **TwiLite** from that page.

The Developer of **TwiLite**, TwilightZebby, is contactable for matters regarding **TwiLite** via GitHub, preferrably via opening an Issue Ticket or Discussion on **TwiLite**'s [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/TwilightZebby/TwiLite).
