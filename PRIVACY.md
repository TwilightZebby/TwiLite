# TwiLite - Privacy Policy
Last Updated: 11th January 2025

Effective: 11th January 2025

---

## Introduction
**TwiLite** does __not__, and will __never__, collect & store Messages, User Data, or Server Data without explicit notice & consent.
Additionally, **TwiLite** will __never__ sell or give away the Data that it does store.

The developers of **TwiLite** firmly believes in a "we don't want your data keep it away from us" process - thus, **TwiLite** will be developed as "stateless" as possible (i.e: without needing to store any information or data at all). If features and functions are not possible to develop "stateless", we will explicitly include them in this **Privacy Policy**, covering exactly what is needed to be stored, for what purpose, and how that data can be removed from **TwiLite** on request.

**TwiLite**'s source code is viewable in **TwiLite**'s GitHub Repo ( https://github.com/TwilightZebby/TwiLite ).

## Data Collection & Purposes
TwiLite currently does *not* collect or store *any* data or information from any Users or Servers that use or interact with TwiLite.

Should this change, it will be added to this Privacy Policy *before* the revelant feature(s) are publicly released into TwiLite.

---

## Use of Locale Data
**TwiLite** makes use of the publicly available locale data (i.e: what language Users and Servers have set) Discord sends to all Server/User Apps using Discord's public API for "Interactions" (e.g: Slash Commands, Context Commands, Select Menus, Buttons, Modals). This locale data is only used for knowing which language **TwiLite** should send its responses in, and is __NOT__ stored or tracked in any way.

You can see the public API Documentation regarding what the locale data includes on these official Discord API Documentation Pages:
- [API Locale Reference](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#locales)
- [Locale field in Interaction Objects](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-object)

## Final Notes
If you decide to stop using **TwiLite** as a Server App, then **TwiLite** will automatically remove all data connected to a Server when it is removed or kicked from the Server in question.

If, as a User, you have left all Servers **TwiLite** is in as a Server App (and thus, no longer have any mutual Servers with **TwiLite**), then **TwiLite** will automatically remove all data connected to the User in question.

If you have added **TwiLite** to your Discord Account as a User App, and you no longer want it as a User App, you can freely remove it again at any time by navigating to Discord's User Settings -> Authorized Apps, and revoking **TwiLite** from that page.

The Developer of **TwiLite**, TwilightZebby, is contactable for matters regarding **TwiLite** via GitHub, preferrably via opening an Issue Ticket or Discussion on **TwiLite**'s [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/TwilightZebby/TwiLite).

*This Privacy Policy is subject to change at any time.*
